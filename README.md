# Solaire

## The Turn-Based Strategy Game, Revisited! 

### About

Solaire was the name of the final project I built for my A-Level coursework in 2019. It covered user research, development frameworks and communicating with stakeholders to build an app meeting user requirements.

Despite not much time having passed since I finished this project, I've learned a lot from a software development standpoint, and I'd love to see what the project will become with my new skills.

A small brainstorming session using the knowledge vs priority grid has helped prioritize features I want to work on first.
Features like a login system and displaying assets on the web-app are features that are both high priority and I have a high knowledge of how to do them.
Meanwhile, a feature like moving health bars that are in coordination with the monster health points is a feature I have less knowledge of how to do, but also is not as high a priority for the final product.
